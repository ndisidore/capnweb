<h1 align="center">Cap'n Web: A JavaScript-native RPC system</h1>

Cap'n Web is a spiritual sibling to [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) (and is created by the
same author), but designed to play nice in the web stack. That means:

* Like Cap'n Proto, it is an **object-capability protocol**. ("Cap'n" is short for "capabilities
  and.") It's incredibly powerful.
* Unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web has **no schemas**. In fact, it has almost no boilerplate
  whatsoever. This means it works more like the
  [JavaScript-native RPC system in Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/javascript-native-rpc/).
* That said, it integrates nicely with TypeScript.
* Also unlike Cap'n Proto, Cap'n Web's underlying serialization is **human-readable**. It's just
  JSON, with a little pre- and post-processing.
* It works over HTTP, WebSocket, and `postMessage()` out of the box, and can be extended to other
  transports easily.
* It works in all major browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, Bun, Deno, and other modern
  JavaScript runtimes.

The whole thing compresses (minify + gzip) to **under 16 kB with no dependencies**.

Cap'n Web is more expressive than almost every other RPC system, because it implements an
object-capability RPC model. That means it supports **bidirectional calling**, **passing functions
and objects by reference**, **promise pipelining** (chaining dependent calls into a single network
round trip), and **capability-based security patterns**, where holding a reference *is* the
permission to use it.

## Installation

[Cap'n Web is an npm package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/capnweb)

```sh
npm i capnweb
```

There is no build step, no schema compiler, and no code generation.

```js
import { RpcTarget, newWebSocketRpcSession } from "capnweb";
```

To use `using` declarations, your `tsconfig.json` needs `"target": "esnext"` and matching `lib`s.
See [Installation](packages/docs/src/content/docs/start/installation.mdx).

## Example

A client looks like this:

```js
import { newWebSocketRpcSession } from "capnweb";

// One-line setup.
let api = newWebSocketRpcSession("wss://example.com/api");

// Call a method on the server!
let result = await api.hello("World");

console.log(result);
```

Here's the server:

```js
import { RpcTarget, newWorkersRpcResponse } from "capnweb";

// This is the server implementation.
class MyApiServer extends RpcTarget {
  hello(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`
  }
}

// Standard Cloudflare Workers HTTP handler.
//
// (Node, Deno, Bun and other runtimes are supported too.)
export default {
  fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Parse URL for routing.
    let url = new URL(request.url);

    // Serve API at `/api`.
    if (url.pathname === "/api") {
      return newWorkersRpcResponse(request, new MyApiServer());
    }

    // You could serve other endpoints here...
    return new Response("Not found", {status: 404});
  }
}
```

And here is the part that makes it interesting. Three dependent calls, one round trip:

```ts
using api = newHttpBatchRpcSession<Api>("https://example.com/api");

// No awaits, so no round trips yet.
using authed = api.authenticate(apiToken);
let friendIds = authed.getFriendIds();

// One await. One round trip. Everything above travelled together.
let friends = await friendIds.map(id => api.getUserProfile(id));
```

## Examples

Runnable examples live in [`examples/`](examples/):

* [`batch-pipelining`](examples/batch-pipelining/): three dependent calls in one HTTP round trip.
* [`worker-react`](examples/worker-react/): a React app against a Cap'n Web Worker, with runtime
  validation at the RPC boundary.
* [`session-recovery`](examples/session-recovery/): a WebSocket session with a button that kills
  it, showing what a disconnect destroys and what it takes to resume without a gap.

## Related packages

* [`capnweb-validate`](packages/capnweb-validate/): generates runtime validators from your
  TypeScript types at build time, since TypeScript types are erased and a malicious peer can send
  anything.

## Security

Cap'n Web gives you strong authorization tools, but a few things are your responsibility:
authenticating in-band rather than with cookies, rate-limiting because pipelining is cheap for
attackers, setting transport payload limits, and validating types at runtime. Read
[Security considerations](packages/docs/src/content/docs/guides/security.mdx) before exposing a
service to untrusted peers.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
